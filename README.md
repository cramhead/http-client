[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.3-blue.svg)](extension.toml)

## Features

- 🚀 **Send HTTP requests** directly from `.http` files in Zed
- 🎨 **Syntax highlighting** for HTTP request files

- 🔧 **Headers and request bodies** with JSON, XML, and other formats
- 📊 **Response viewer** with formatted output
- 💻 **Cross-platform** - Automatic binary downloads for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- ⚡ **Fast and lightweight** - Built with Rust and WebAssembly

## Installation

### From Zed Extensions

1. Open Zed editor
2. Press `cmd+shift+p` (macOS) or `ctrl+shift+p` (Linux/Windows)
3. Type "extensions" and select "zed: extensions"
4. Search for "Http Client"
5. Click "Install"

### Manual Installation

Clone this repository and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cramhead/http-client.git
cd http-client
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/http_client.wasm extension.wasm
```

## Usage

### Creating an HTTP Request File

Create a file with the `.http` extension and write your requests:

```http
# Simple GET request
GET https://api.github.com/users/octocat
Accept: application/json

###

# POST request with JSON body
POST https://httpbin.org/post
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}

###

# Request with headers
GET https://api.example.com/data
Authorization: Bearer your-token-here
Accept: application/json
```

### Request Syntax

- **Request Line**: `METHOD URL`
- **Headers**: `Header-Name: value` (one per line)
- **Body**: Leave a blank line after headers, then add your request body
- **Separator**: Use `###` to separate multiple requests in one file

### Executing Requests

1. Open a `.http` file
2. Use code actions (code lenses) to execute requests
3. View results in the `http-responses.http` file

## How It Works

### Architecture

The extension consists of two main components:

#### 1. Zed Extension (WebAssembly)
- **Location**: `src/lib.rs`
- **Purpose**: Integrates with Zed's extension system
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Registers `.http` file support
  - Manages LSP server lifecycle
  - Handles platform detection and binary distribution
  - Downloads and caches the appropriate LSP server binary

#### 2. LSP Server (Native Binary)
- **Location**: `lsp/`
- **Purpose**: Language Server Protocol implementation
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parses `.http` files
  - Executes HTTP requests
  - Formats responses
  - Provides code lenses for request execution

### Binary Distribution

The extension automatically downloads the correct LSP server binary for your platform:

1. **Platform Detection**: Detects your OS and architecture
2. **Cache Check**: Looks for cached binary
3. **Download**: If not cached, downloads from GitHub Releases
4. **Execution**: Makes binary executable and starts the LSP server

Supported platforms:
- macOS (Intel x86_64 and Apple Silicon aarch64)
- Linux (x86_64 and aarch64)
- Windows (x86_64)

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs))
- `wasm32-wasip1` target: `rustup target add wasm32-wasip1`
- Zed editor

```

### Building

**Build the extension:**
```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
cp target/wasm32-wasip1/release/http_client.wasm extension.wasm
```

**Build the LSP server:**
```bash
cd lsp
cargo build --release
```

For development, create a `bin/` directory in your workspace and copy the LSP binary there. The extension will use this instead of downloading:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
cp lsp/target/release/http-lsp bin/
```

### Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests (51 tests across both crates)
cargo test --workspace

# Run extension tests only
cargo test -p http-client

# Run LSP tests only
cargo test -p http-lsp
```

Tests use `rstest` for parametrized testing and cover:
- HTTP request parsing (all methods, headers, bodies)
- Response formatting and display
- Edge cases (comments, empty files, multiple requests)
